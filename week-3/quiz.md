1) Define a variable named "me" as a string with your name in it.

2) Define a variable named "me" as a string with your name in it and another
   variable named "favorite_color" with your favorite color. Then define a
   third variable named "sentence" that uses string interpolation to form
   a sentence that prints "My name is _____ and my favorite color is _____"
   where _____ is your name and then your favorite color

3) Repeat the work in question two but define a method called "about_me"
   that takes in your name and your favorite color and prints the sentence

4) Create a class for a cash machine. It should have attributes for the
   name of the bank, the address, and the total dollar amount in the machine.

5) Add a method to your class that prints how much money is in the machine.

6) Create an instance of your cash machine for the First Bank of Ruby located
   at 500 Iron Yard Way, and has 5,000 of cash. Use the method from question-5
   to print how much money is in the machine

7) Add a method to your class to withdraw an amount of money. Again create the
   instance of the cash machine from question-6. Using your new method, withdraw
   100 from the machine and then print the current total dollar amount in the machine.

8) What are the kinds of variables we have learned about so far?

9) Use enumerable methods to print if there are any numbers greater than 75 in this
   array:

   numbers = [46, 61, 41, 1, 53, 81, 57, 68, 48, 37, 71, 35, 21, 88, 73, 74, 58, 84, 87, 6, 38, 9, 55, 36, 89, 67, 30, 60, 32, 68, 88, 30, 19, 64, 9, 30, 67, 0, 8, 87, 43, 68, 67, 52, 37, 63, 55, 89, 11, 4]

10) Use enumerable to make:
    a new variable (called "greater_than_eighty") with all the numbers greater than 80
    a new variable (called "greater_than_ninety") with all the numbers greater than 90
